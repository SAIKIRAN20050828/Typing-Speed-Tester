This is a small, independent back-end server with one single responsibility: to provide random paragraphs for the typing test. It's a classic example of a microservice.

Purpose: A dedicated API for serving text data.

Contents: server.js, package.json.

Code for server.js:
This code is identical to the back-end in the 2-repository split. It's already a perfect microservice.

// server.js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.use(cors());

const paragraphs = [
    "A paragraph is a collection of words combined together.",
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "Technology has revolutionized the way we live and work."
];

// The single endpoint for this microservice
app.get('/api/paragraph', (req, res) => {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * paragraphs.length);
    res.json({ text: paragraphs[randomIndex] });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Paragraph service running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
